## Leveraging friend communities
- [Squad Wealth](https://otherinter.net/research/squad-wealth/)
- [Friend groups](https://nayafia.substack.com/p/27-friend-groups)

> "A group of friends who enjoy each others' company ought to build something together."

> "Let's buy a bar together."

> "Let's buy land and move to the country and raise our kids together."

- [How to build a Fren Movement](https://telegra.ph/How-to-build-a-Fren-Movement-08-16)

> "To have a good networking is essential to face the challenges of our days. Alone we are nothing."

- [Webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring)

 only around 10% to 20% of people in a given community will end up being regulars

## Community lore
Local memes, shared memories.
This stuff at large scale makes nations.

- [Why Losing Bonds Sports Fans](https://www.sapiens.org/culture/football-fans/)

Communities centered around holding a specific token are a lot like sports fans.
