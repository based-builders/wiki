### Forums
Perhaps not relevant for small communities that can fit all happening conversation in one place.
- Why your community needs a forum (e. g. Discourse) for important discussions besides a chat like Telegram or Discord
	- [If it will matter after today, stop talking about it in a chat room](https://critter.blog/2021/01/12/if-it-matters-after-today-stop-talking-about-it-in-a-chat-room/) ‚≠êÔ∏è
	- [Please stop closing forums and moving people to Discord](https://kotaku.com/please-stop-closing-forums-and-moving-people-to-discord-1847684851)
- [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) ([Github](https://github.com/discourse/discourse))
	- Used by most DAOs ([Yearn](https://gov.yearn.finance/), [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/), etc.)
	- Users need to register with email. A lot of people won't bother and won't take part in discussions.
