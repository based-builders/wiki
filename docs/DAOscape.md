> A DAO is a commitment to share value with a community.
> 
> DAOs seek to:
> 
> -   Provide members with a voice through governance.
> -   Flatten hierarchy and create fluid workstreams.
> -   Allocate resources to achieve a core mission.
> 
> A Telegram group with 10 members and 1 ETH is a DAO.
> 
> A DeFi protocol with $1B+ of assets governed on-chain by 10,000+ token holders is a DAO.
>
> **Regardless of size, DAOs look to solve core missions - evolving a group chat into a success-driven community.**
