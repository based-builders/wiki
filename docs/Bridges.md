## Bridge aggregation
- [transferto.xyz](https://transferto.xyz/) (aka li.fi)
- [bungee.exchange](https://bungee.exchange/) (formerly Movr)

Tip: You can check best routes on aggregators, then execute suggested paths manually (this will potentially save you from the aggregator fee)

## Gas bridging
Some bridges can help get you gas on chains where you have none yet.

- [elk.finance](https://elk.finance/)
	- when using ElkNet bridge, use the `Swap $ELK 1 for gas` feature
- [bungee.exchange/refuel](https://www.bungee.exchange/refuel)
- you can use a [CEX](CEX) to buy the gas token
